@article{Haxby2014,
abstract = {A major challenge for systems neuroscience is to break the neural code. Computational algorithms for encoding information into neural activity and extracting information from measured activity afford understanding of how percepts, memories, thought, and knowledge are represented in patterns of brain activity. The past decade and a half has seen significant advances in the development of methods for decoding human neural activity, such as multivariate pattern classification, representational similarity analysis, hyperalignment, and stimulus-model-based encoding and decoding. This article reviews these advances and integrates neural decoding methods into a common framework organized around the concept of high-dimensional representational spaces.},

@article{Oram1998,
abstract = {Information processing in the nervous system involves the activity of large populations of neurons. It is possible, however, to interpret the activity of relatively small numbers of cells in terms of meaningful aspects of the environment. `Bayesian inference' provides a systematic and effective method of combining information from multiple cells to accomplish this. It is not a model of a neural mechanism (neither are alternative methods, such as the population vector approach) but a tool for analysing neural signals. It does not require difficult assumptions about the nature of the dimensions underlying cell selectivity, about the distribution and tuning of cell responses or about the way in which information is transmitted and processed. It can be applied to any parameter of neural activity (for example, firing rate or temporal pattern). In this review, we demonstrate the power of Bayesian analysis using examples of visual responses of neurons in primary visual and temporal cortices. We show that interaction between correlation in mean responses to different stimuli (signal) and correlation in response variability within stimuli (noise) can lead to marked improvement of stimulus discrimination using population responses.},

@article{Yarrow2012,
abstract = {The precision of the neural code is commonly investigated using two families of statistical measures: Shannon mutual information and derived quantities when investigating very small populations of neurons and Fisher information when studying large populations. These statistical tools are no longer the preserve of theorists and are being applied by experimental research groups in the analysis of empirical data. Although the relationship between information-theoretic and Fisher-based measures in the limit of infinite populations is relatively well understood, how these measures compare in finite-size populations has not yet been systematically explored. We aim to close this gap. We are particularly interested in understanding which stimuli are best encoded by a given neuron within a population and how this depends on the chosen measure. We use a novel Monte Carlo approach to compute a stimulus-specific decomposition of the mutual information (the SSI) for populations of up to 256 neurons and show that Fisher information can be used to accurately estimate both mutual information and SSI for populations of the order of 100 neurons, even in the presence of biologically realistic variability, noise correlations, and experimentally relevant integration times. According to both measures, the stimuli that are best encoded are those falling at the flanks of the neuron's tuning curve. In populations of fewer than around 50 neurons, however, Fisher information can be misleading.},
