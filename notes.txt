Variability of GA (around AGA)

reduces to the following problem

I have real numbers a_1,...,a_n

And subsets S_1,...,S_m of {1,...,n}

with |S_j| = k for j = 1,..,m

and sum_j I(i in S_j) = l for i = 1,..,n

(therefore n * l = k * m)

Define X_j = sum_{i in S_j} a_i 

Define X as random variable for J unif in 1....m

Then what is maximum of E[X^2]?

Claim: E[X^2] is maximized when there is a total ordering on S_1,...,S_m

Suppose not.  Then there is S_i, S_j where we can find a "swap" that increases E[X^2]
* this needs to be shown and it might not be true
* But if it is true, then it greatly reduces the set of possibly optimal collections {S_i}
